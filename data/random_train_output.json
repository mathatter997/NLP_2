'Anyone who has tried to play complex video games will know they are difficult.' Speaking to The Times, Prof Mcfarlane said she had developed an obsession with both Angry Birds and a precursor, Lemmings, because they had made her think and get her strategy right. The education expert, who has advised the government on educational technology, and who is currently writing a book, Authentic Learning for the Digital Generation, said computer games could be used in the classroom to good effect provided it was done properly. Prof Mcfarlane said even pre-school children could benefit from games, as long as they were supervised and not just given a phone to play with to keep them quiet. Prof Mcfarlane said she herself had become 'hooked' on a computer game called Lemmings, pictured . She said some games could teach children fine motor control, or help with vocabulary or simple maths, and taught skills such as resilience that could be applicable to real life.

Crime behind bars: Damien Miller will spend another ten years in jail after he masterminded a heroin and cocaine racket from his cell . A drugs baron will spend another ten years behind bars for masterminding another heroin and cocaine racket from his prison cell. Damien Miller, 31, was serving seven years for supplying drugs to his home city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire yet he began a new criminal enterprise when he being transferred to an open prison. Whilst on day release from North Sea Camp Prison in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices. He then formed a new gang which peddled drugs in Stoke-on-Trent whilst he served out the rest of his stretch over 120 miles away. He even managed to pay \u00a315,000 from drug dealing into his own bank account. Police began investigating after noticing a rise in violent organised crime in Stoke and discovered Miller was the ringleader. They alerted bosses at the jail and began a surveillance operation and discovered that he was organising new drugs deals. John Phillips, 29, was Miller\u2019s \u2018right-hand man\u2019 in Stoke-on-Trent and controlled the day-to-day running of the drug crime while Miller remained in behind bars in Lincolnshire where he was said to be building a \u2018comfortable life\u2019 from the profits. Police arrested in Miller in June last year after seizing more than 2.2lbs of heroin and cocaine worth around \u00a3100,000 and using mobile phone records to link low-level couriers to Miller and Phillips. At Stafford Crown Court in Knutton, Miller admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Phillips of Stoke, was jailed for seven and a half years and another seven men and two women were jailed for a total of 23 years. Passing sentence Judge Michael Cullum told Miller today: \u2018You had a role which was highly significant or borderline leading. \u2018Clearly you conducted this enterprise while held at an open prison. This is a seriously aggravating feature.\u2019 Former businessman Miller was initially jailed in 2009 after heading an operation to supply the dealers of Stoke with 2.2lbs of cocaine worth up to \u00a388,000 which he bought from a Liverpool wholesale dealer. New criminal enterprise: While on day release from North Sea Camp Prison (pictured) in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices . He claimed he was \u2018not an organiser\u2019 and was acting \u2018under orders\u2019 and had once fled to Spain fearing he was about to be assassinated. But police began investigating him again in 2011 after reports of wide scale drug dealing in the city. Between March and June police carried out a series of raids and intercepted deliveries of varying amounts of cocaine, heroin and cash. After each seizure of drugs, police observed increased contact between Miller, Phillips and other accomplices. Over the course of the investigation, police seized more than 2.2lbs of cocaine and heroin from the conspirators. Miller deposited \u00a315,000 in his bank account over the three month period, while Phillips\u2019 income totalled \u00a32,680. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Clews, head of Staffordshire Police\u2019s Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: \u2018Building a case against Miller, Phillips and their associates took a considerable team effort involving several agencies and police departments. Miles away: Miller began building a 'comfortable life' from the profits of the drug ring while in the open prison . New gang peddling drugs:\u00a0 John Phillips (right) was Miller's 'right hand man', controlling the day-to-day running of the drug crime and and was convicted along with seven men, including Dane Parker (left), and two women to over the enterprise . \u2018Miller did not handle the drugs himself, but got other people to do his dirty work for him. As head of the group he was controlling everyone, and everything, from a distance. \u2018But by piecing together a series of events we were able to uncover Miller\u2019s involvement and the extent of his crime, along with that of all the others involved. \u2018We gathered evidence of events which led to cash and drugs being recovered. We have CCTV footage of Phillips meeting Miller at a pub in Nottingham. All aspects of Miller\u2019s life in Lincolnshire were thoroughly investigated. \u2018This case has also shown that some of those involved in this Organised Crime Group were vulnerable individuals who were easily manipulated by Miller and Phillips. People like this, who are so easily exploited by criminals, end up paying a high price.\u2019 Governor of North Sea Camp Prison, Graham Batchford, said: \u2018We are not complacent about prisoners who breach their licence conditions. \u2018Today\u2019s outcome is proof that we will take every measure possible, including working close with the police, to ensure that those who fall foul of the terms of their temporary release are swiftly brought to justice.\u2019 Dane Parker, 23, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and conspiracy to money launder. He was jailed for three years, eight months. Scott Mosedale, 26, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was sentenced to two years, eight months. 'Borderline leading': While Miller claimed he was not 'an organiser' and was acting 'under orders', Judge Michael Cullum said in Stafford Crown Court (pictured) today that he had clearly conducted the enterprise while in an open prison . Ryan Jones, 27, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted possessing criminal property and conspiracy to money launder. He received a sentence of one year, two months. Stephanie Pitchford, 22, and Kerry Wilkinson, 25, both of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. They were sentenced to two years and one year, eight months respectively. Anthony Bostock, 32, of Stoke-on-Trent, . admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. He has been jailed for two years, . three months. Byron Dunkley, 21, of Stafford, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He has gone to prison for 16 months.

Mr Calder managed to get out of the car park and abandoned his car in a nearby street before he and his injured mother staggered to hospital. The nearest hospital, North Manchester General, is about a half-hour walk away. Doctors then called police to investigate the shooting. Neither injury was believed to be life-threatening. The incident occurred in the gritty Manchester district of Harpurhey where controversial BBC Three reality TV show People Like Us was based - and which was critically panned for showing a stereotypical view of the locals. Just minutes before the shooting Mr . Calder posted a message on his Facebook page saying: 'Stab me in the . back, I'll blast ur spine.' Another posted on January 5 said: 'n this game there's only one don' and on Jan 9 he wrote: 'Even if I died young who cares.'

Now 300 wounded or emotionally-traumatised soldiers will have a little piece of Britain to call their own. A pioneering \u00a327million veterans' village is set to be built on a 55-acre site in the scenic countryside. Pioneering: A new retreat is being built for injured veterans and will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility (2), 200 bungalows (7), a leisure centre (3) and a donkey sanctuary (11) The village will include a fully-staffed 90-bed nursing and care facility, 200 bungalows, leisure centre with swimming pool, social club, lakes, woodland walks and a donkey sanctuary. In a first of its kind in the UK, its population will almost entirely be made up of former troops who have suffered horrific physical or psychological injuries on the battlefield. A large number of servicemen and women will have been badly-wounded in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The project, dreamed up by the Veteran's Retreat charity, would be built on a former tileworks close to the hamlet of Newlands, Northumberland, and the village of Ebchester, County Durham. The trustees will seek planning permission in December and hope to open the first homes and care facility late next year. Despite concerns from local residents that the new development will blight the countryside, the charity points out that it is on a brown-field site that housed a factory. The veterans' village will also create up to 500 jobs in an area hit hard by unemployment and pump money into the local economy. The plans were launched by Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry, the youngest soldier ever to be awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest military decoration for valour. Launch: Lance Corporal Johnson Beharry VC helped to unveil the new retreat earlier this week and said it would offer something no doctor could . Lance Cpl Beharry, now 32, of the 1st . Battalion, Princess of Wales\u2019s Royal Regiment, was honoured for saving . members of his unit from ambushes on May 1 and June 11, 2004, in Al- . Amarah, Iraq. He suffered . serious head injuries after a rocket propelled grenade hit a vehicle six . inches from his, causing shrapnel injuries to his face and brain. Yet he managed to drag several comrades to safety. He said: 'For guys to be able to sit down and talk about the old days and what they have been through is something that doctors cannot offer. So we, as ex-servicemen and women, are going to cure ourselves. 'We are regimented and we are one family and we will look after each other. On civvy street you do not have that - this is a good way of continuing friendships.' Gary Russell, who suffered a serious leg injury in a landmine explosion in Bosnia, in 1995, said the village would be welcomed by military veterans. Ambitious scheme: Bill Liddle, who is leading the scheme, hopes it will be completed in five years . The father-of-three, from Consett, County Durham, who served with the Royal Fusiliers, said: 'People who are coming out of the service can find it difficult and may need counselling and medical treatment, such as physiotherapy, if they have been injured. 'When you are with someone who has been through what you have been through, you can talk about your experiences and that makes them easier to deal with. 'To have that sort of environment sitting there waiting for you when you come out, with a bungalow if you are in a wheelchair and with medical facilities on tap, is just a brilliant idea.' Veteran's Retreat hopes to raise initial funds of more than \u00a3100,000 to get the project up and running. The ambitious scheme is being led by former military policeman Bill Liddle, 64, who hopes the facility will be completed within five years. He said: 'We want to change the lives of hundreds of ex-service personnel who suffer physical or emotional trauma by providing a unique residential and medical facility, dedicated to the long-term care and support of former troops.

A hallucinogenic drug used in shamanic rituals in the Amazon is growing in popularity in the U.S., researchers have found. Dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, is the active ingredient in ayahuasca, which is a plant-based mixture that can also be smoked to give users a hallucinatory 'journey' more extreme than that of LSD, ketamine or magic mushrooms. Adam Winstock, founder of the Global Drugs Survey, claims it has 'a larger proportion of new users' compared to other powerful drugs. Ayahuasca: A shaman in the Coafan region boils leaves for their psychoactive properties as used in ayahuasca, Ecuador, 2009 . This suggests 'its popularity may increase,' Winstock says in the latest issue of the Journal of Psychopharmacology, according to the Huffington Post. The survey's findings are supported by results of another study, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted by the government, which found the number of people who have used DMT at some point has shot up from an estimated 688,000 in 2006 to 1.47 million in 2012. Smoked: The drug, pictured, which can be smoked is gaining popularity, particularly among young males . Male high school students were the most likely new users, Winstock found, and he says films are to blame for raising awareness about the drug. 'Mainstream interest since the release of the cult film \"Enter the Void\" in 2009 and the 2010 documentary \"DMT: The Spirit Molecule\", followed by a recent article in the influential youth magazine Vice featuring young people who had just smoked DMT will have raised awareness,' Winstock says. The Global Drug Survey is an anonymous study that provides a rare look into the illegal drugs being used at any point in time. Because the study isn't random, it doesn't show the prevalence of certain drugs but it can show, comparatively, which ones seem to be on the rise and how their users take them. According to the 2012 study, . conducted between November and December last year, DMT offers an . 'extreme hallucinatory experience' and users cite a 'bad trip' as a . potential risk.

The first, Psychotria viridis, contains DMT which is listed as a Schedule I drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. By itself, though, DMT has no real effect and requires the second plant in the brew, Banisteriopsis caapi, to enable the brain to neutralize DMT. The brew first came to the attention of Western scientists in 1851, but Amazonian tribes have been using it as a medicinal and religious aid for centuries.

An aspiring Oxbridge student who suffers from a rare condition that stops her coping with stress fears the pressure of cramming for exams could kill her. Jennifer Lloyd's illness means instead of producing adrenalin to cope when she gets anxious, the 17-year-old's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs. She has had to begin revising . for exams months in advance - in the hope she will banish any last minute cramming stress . that could trigger her disease. Rare illness: Jennifer Lloyd, from Prestwich, Manchester, fears cramming for tests more than all of her friends - because exam stress could kill her . Jennifer suffers from Addison's disease . which leaves her in danger of suffering a medical crisis at times of stress. If . she doesn't receive rapid treatment, she vomits, passes out or could . die. The teenager, who is studying for her AS-levels, suffered a major attack that left her in hospital last summer when she was preparing for her GCSEs. And she has even been forced to turn down interviews for Oxbridge schemes because she fears the stress of studying at the world-famous institutions away from home could be deadly. Jennifer, from Prestwich, Manchester, said: 'It's very tough when it gets to exam season as I have to balance my time perfectly. 'The illness leaves me very tired, so my mum often finds me asleep in my books while I've been studying. 'I know I can't let myself get unnecessarily stressed out, so I have to be much more organised than my friends. Addison's disease suffer Jennifer Lloyd studying hard in hospital for her upcoming exams . Talented student Jennifer Lloyd was diagnosed with Addison's disease as a child after her mother Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta . 'As a result I have a strict schedule where, if I do an hour of revision, I have to rest for two hours before doing any more. 'It means I can be short on time so I start preparing weeks in advance of everyone else to fit everything in. 'I . have been offered the chance to go and view Oxford and Cambridge . Universities as part of my college's Gifted and Talented students . programme, which is such an honour - but I just don't feel ready to move . away yet. The teenager with her mother Amanda: Instead of producing adrenalin to cope with stress, Jennifer's body reacts by shutting down her vital organs . Addison's affects around one in every 15,000 people and is caused by a lack of steroid hormones in the body. These are normally produced by the adrenal gland, but damage can cause levels to drop. The disease is normally caused by the body's own immune system turning on the adrenal gland, but cancer and tuberculosis can also trigger the condition. The impact on the body can be significant. One steroid, called cortisol, is involved in controlling how much water there is in the body as well as helping to fight inflammation. Another, aldosterone, regulates salt and water levels and blood pressure. Without properly-functioning adrenal glands the body cannot cope at times of stress - such as surgery, trauma or serious infection. The condition was discovered by Dr Thomas Addison in London in 1849. Jane Austen, John F Kennedy and Osama bin Laden are all thought to have been affected. Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, pathologists found 'almost no adrenal tissue' according to an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Now patients are treated with cheap steroid tablets. 'My college has . been incredibly supportive - my teachers know the danger signs and can . call my mum straight away if they think I'm getting ill. 'After . my first week at college, I wanted to quit because the stress of . meeting so many new people was making me ill, but my mentor, Beverley . Jones, convinced me to stay, which I'm really grateful for.' Jennifer . is gearing up for AS-level exams in psychology, geography, business and . photography, at Pendleton Sixth Form College, knowing she has to . prepare well in advance in case Addison's disease strikes. If she doesn't receive rapid treatment, the student suffers an Addisonian crisis where her eyes roll to the back of her head and she starts vomiting, requiring urgent hospital treatment. Now, after a decade, Jennifer is always prepared for when a 'crisis' hits, carrying a hydro-cortisone injection at all times - and she doubles her normal medication on the run up to important exams. She added: 'I want to be a child psychologist, but it's hard to study for exams because they're really stressful. 'I did most of my revision last year hooked up to a drip in hospital - my weight dropped to 5st10lb because my stomach stopped absorbing fats. 'I was thrilled when I managed to gain 10 A grades and two A*s though - all the stress paid off!' Jennifer was first diagnosed with Addison's 10 years ago after her mother, Amanda, 51, noticed her craving salt on a family holiday to Malta. She said: 'The first time we noticed any of Jennifer's symptoms was when we were on holiday - she was eating salt straight from the shakers on restaurant tables. 'The rest of the family went a bit pink from the sun too, but Jennifer went very brown - she looked like she'd had a terrible spray tan. 'When we got home, we took her straight to the doctor's for tests, and we discovered she was craving salt because her body wasn't retaining it. 'She was diagnosed with Addison's weeks later, and in many ways it was a relief to finally know what was wrong, but the condition is hard for us all to live with.' In 2004 Amanda started a charity, called Jenny's Pennies, which has raised \u00a317,000 for the endocrine department at Manchester Children's Hospital in appreciation of Jennifer's care.", "summary": "The teenager, who is studying for her AS-levels, suffered a major attack that left her in hospital last summer when she was preparing for her GCSEs .

The owner of a care home where elderly residents were dragged across the floor has dismissed a damning inspection report claiming it was based on a 'bad day'. Care inspectors found residents were left lying on filthy mattresses at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, while poor cleanliness also exposed them to the risk of infection. The Care Quality Commission report said poor staffing levels meant patients were at risk of being neglected while inspectors also found 'unpleasant odours', stains on patients' mattresses and filthy commodes which had not been cleaned properly. A damning report has revealed elderly residents at Teme Court Residential Care, in Worcester, were dragged across the floor and left lying on filthy mattresses . But owner Sharanjit Purewal has defended the care home, saying: 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it. 'There are other homes in the area which have had much worse reports but they don't get taken out of proportion like this. 'The CQC has changed the goal posts slightly and that is something we are dealing with. 'We can't have changed overnight and our report in February was good, we have exactly the same staff.' Mr Purewal, who has owned the home since 2009, said: 'The staffing has improved since I have been here. 'The families like what we do and we move people on if we can't care for them.' CQC inspectors gave the care home a deadline of October 30 to improve its standards. Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) demanded improvements at the home, which caters for 18 residents who mainly suffer from dementia . Inspectors have not yet revisited the home to check if the standards are being met but will publish a further report in due course when they have. The care home failed all six requirements and for five of these areas the CQC said action was needed. These included the residents consenting to any care and treatment given, the care and welfare of people at the home, the home's cleanliness and infection control, the home's staffing and how their records are kept. 'It was just one of those bad days where certain things weren't right. It was nothing major and I am dealing with the CQC on it' - Care home owner Sharanjit Purewal . But for assessing and monitoring the quality of service the CQC has taken enforcement action against the home - the most severe warning the watchdog can issue. On three occasions staff 'dragged' patients across the floor of the care home by their walking frames while ordering the residents to 'come on' if they were too slow. Another patient was also left lying on the floor after falling during the night. Poor records meant staff had no idea how long the person had been left stranded. The report said: 'We found the items listed were not clean and had sustained heavy soiling. 'For example, some of the commodes had stains to the pans and dried brown matter to the frames and under the seat of the chairs.' Inspectors also found dirty laundry stored in an open laundry basket with more heavily soiled items stored in the washing machine because 'staff told us they were only allowed to wash clothes at night'. The report added: 'We found that all of the mattresses we looked at were stained and had unpleasant odours.' The care home failed in all six of the inspection criteria . Staffing levels were deemed inadequate to deal with the needs of all 18 residents in the home and relief workers were not called in if staff failed to arrive for a shift - piling 'more pressure' on staff on duty. The report said: 'We noted from one person\u2019s care records that they had fallen during the night but staff were unable to determine the time this person had spent on the floor. 'For example, this person had been observed at 2.30am and found on the bedroom floor at 4am. 'We saw three instances where staff led people by dragging their frames. They encouraged people by saying: \"Come on X\" to hurry people along. 'This was because there were not enough staff to help people to the dining rooms.' The inspectors flagged the incident as 'unsafe' and received assurances it would be immediately addressed. The inspection also found care plans were not reviewed regularly and kept up-to-date and that monitoring and record-keeping of the service provided was inadequate. Many of the residents at Teme Court suffer from dementia-related illnesses and the CQC ordered owner Teme Care Limited to make improvements or face possible closure. The report concluded: 'We have taken enforcement action against Teme Care Limited to protect the health, safety and welfare of people using this service.' Worcestershire County Council and the county\u2019s three clinical commissioning groups have also been informed of the inspection.

Stacey Dean Rambold, 55, was resentenced by Judge Randal Spaulding exactly a year after he completed an initial one-month prison term for the crime. Rambold appeared to grimace as the new sentence was read. He was then handcuffed and led away by deputies, pausing briefly to exchange words with family as he exited the courtroom. Former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold, was sent to jail for a second time for the rape of a 14-year-old student who later committed suicide . Rambold received 10 years in prison after an earlier sentence was overturned and the judge who imposed it censured over his comments about the victim . Former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold is led away in handcuffs after being sentenced to 10 years in state prison . Rambold pleaded guilty to a single count of sexual intercourse without consent in the 2007 incident involving 14-year-old Cherice Moralez, a freshman in his Billings Senior High School business class. She committed suicide in 2010. The state Supreme Court overturned Rambold's initial sentence, citing in part comments from Judge G. Todd Baugh who suggested the victim shared responsibility. Baugh was censured and suspended for 31 days. He's stepping down when his terms ends in January. Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he was pleased with the sentence that included five additional years that were suspended. Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . John Moralez holds up pictures of his daughter when she was a child during the sentencing hearing. He said he had hoped for a still longer sentence \u2014 but, he added, a decade is better than a month . Montana District Judge Randal Spaulding pronounces a 10-year prison sentence with another five years suspended for former teacher Stacey Dean Rambold convicted of raping one of his students . Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . 'The criminal justice system worked today,' he said. John Moralez, the father of the victim, had hoped for a longer sentence but said it was better than the one-month previously serviced by Rambold. During the hearing, Twito asked Judge Spaulding to reject defense attempts to make the victim's conduct in the case a factor in Rambold's sentencing. That included references by the defendant's attorney to video-taped interviews of the victim recorded by law enforcement prior to her death. Those recordings, which have never been made public, had been cited by Baugh during his sentencing. Under state law, children under 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. 'The last thing we want to do is sit here in the criminal justice system and say, 'What is the age?' It doesn't matter. Fourteen is way too young,' Twito said. 'There has to be punishment. ... Punishment means prison.' Rambold's attorney, Jay Lansing, responded that there was no statute preventing the court from considering Moralez's conduct. He pointed out that similar objections were never raised by prosecutors during Rambold's first sentence, and said they were seeking a 'do-over,' which Lansing asserted was not allowed under state and federal law. Outrageous: Rambold has previously said that his 14-year-old victim ChericeMoralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she appeared older than her actual age . District Judge G. Todd Baugh: Baughsentenced Rambold to one-month in jail in 2013. He has since admitted his huge mistake and even triedto re-sentence Rambold in August of that year but failed . In a letter to the court, Rambold sought forgiveness and lamented the international publicity his case has generated. 'No one can really appreciate and understand what it feels like to have so many people actually hate you and be disgusted by you,' Rambold wrote. 'I do not mention this for the sake of sympathy, but it has been hard.' Twito asked the court to impose a 10-year prison sentence with another 10 years suspended. That is the same sentence prosecutors sought last year when the case was before Baugh, who instead adopted the much more lenient term suggested by Rambold's defense attorney. Without Moralez, their primary witness, prosecutors struck a deal with Rambold that initially allowed him to avoid prison altogether. Rambold, however, violated that agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and entering into a relationship with an adult woman without telling his counselor. As a result, the case was revived and Rambold pleaded guilty last year to the count of sexual intercourse without consent. Spaulding sentenced Rambold \u00a0(pictured here) \u00a0after a 90-minute hearing that included testimony from the victim's mother and father and Rambold's probation and parole officer . Tthe victim\u2019s age, Rambold\u2019s position as a teacher and his response to being warned by school officials all factored into his sentencing. Rambold didn\u2019t force himself on his victim and has completed sex offender treatment . During the first sentencing, Baugh suggested the victim had as much control over her rape as the defendant and said she 'appeared older than her chronological age.' He gave Rambold a 15-year term with all but one month suspended. That triggered an appeal from prosecutors and ultimately resulted in the case being reassigned to Spaulding. Baugh's comments and the lenient sentence he handed down landed him before the state Supreme Court for disciplinary proceedings, which resulted in a 30-day suspension from the bench and a public censure for his misconduct in the case. In a sentencing memorandum filed this week, Twito wrote that a tough sentence for Rambold was warranted given his position of authority over Moralez. 'His position of trust as a high school teacher, abuse of that position, and violations against the victim overshadows all mitigating circumstances,' Twito wrote.", "summary": "' He gave Rambold a 15-year term with all but one month suspended .

This has left a generation . desensitised to the obscene language and sexual images which have become . the \u2018wallpaper\u2019 of children\u2019s lives, said a report for the British . Board of Film Classification. Parents . said they worried about what children aged ten to 15 were now able to . view using phones, tablets such as iPads and computers -\u2013 even though in . many cases they bought the devices for them. They also expressed . concern about the surge in sleepovers, which often have little adult . supervision and allow children to watch films their parents would not . approve of. Children were also seen as desensitised to the sexualisation of young women. The . BBFC report said: \u2018For many parents, technology is in the hands of the . young and the balance of power within the household has shifted.\u2019 The Daily Mail has campaigned for an opt-in system of filters. The scheme, slowly being rolled out by the internet giants, would mean adults would actively have to ask for the household to have access to X-rated websites. Researchers for the BBFC questioned 10,000 people \u2013 including teenagers \u2013\u00a0 about the viewing habits of young people, for the report to accompany its new guidance on film classification. Children are viewing often illegal websites with friends using new technology like iPads . The British Board of Film Classification has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the UK. Videos made featuring artists such as Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Britney Spears could be targeted following the large-scale public consultation. The body said there are \u2018special worries\u2019 about sexual content in music videos. The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch. In its report it noted: \u2018A specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls, and pornography. \u2018The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.\u2019 It also said the \u2018sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern\u2019. \u2018Music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls\u2019 emotional wellbeing and social development,\u2019 the report said. \u2018The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.\u2019 \u2018Parents are working hard to maintain . control, yet feel that the tide of information and challenging content . can sometimes be against them,\u2019 the report said. \u2018By . age 15, most parents argued that it was \u201cgame over\u201d and they could no . longer control their child\u2019s viewing. They were fairly pragmatic about . the way in which their children were viewing films \u2013 online, at friends, . illegally downloading.\u2019 The fears raised in the report were echoed by Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee. \u2018Now so much viewing is done online. All it requires is for the viewer aged 15 to know what the parental lock password is and it\u2019s very easy to get around,\u2019 he said. \u2018It is perfectly true that most children over 15 are very familiar and literate with digital distribution online and therefore for parents to control it is much harder.\u2019 The BBFC report said that because children are now able to watch films using portable devices on their own in their rooms or with their friends, \u2018childhood years and their innocence are felt to be under threat with children being exposed to age-inappropriate content... at an earlier age than ever before\u2019. The results support the findings of the Bailey review in 2011, which said: \u2018Children are under significant pressure to grow up at a faster pace than ever before.

Videotape allegedly shows an unidentified police officer assaulting student Marshawn Pitts, 15. Ed Manzke, an attorney who represents the student, Marshawn Pitts, 15, told CNN Wednesday the officer beat Pitts for not adhering to the school's dress code. The incident occurred in May at the Academy for Learning, a Dolton high school for special-needs students. Pitts was admitted to the school in May after moving from Iowa, Manzke said. He suffered brain injuries as a child when he was hit by a car. The police officer, who has not been identified, reprimanded Pitts for not tucking in his shirt as school dress code and policy requires. A video, released to Pitts' parents by the school several weeks after the incident, showed Pitts talking to the officer and a faculty member grabbing Pitts' arm. Pitts pulls away and walks down the hall, with the officer and faculty member close behind. But the officer then slams him against the lockers and pins him on the floor -- breaking his nose, according to Manzke. Pitts was treated by a school nurse after the incident, then taken to the Dolton Police Department, where his mother picked him up, Manzke said. The officer was taken to a hospital and treated for an eye scratch, Manzke said. But, he said, the officer was never charged with anything and an explanation for the incident was never provided. In a written statement, Guy Lindsay, internal information officer for Dolton police, said the department was made aware of the incident and the tape on May 20. After review of the tape, the officer was removed from the school and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, Lindsay said. While on administrative leave, the police officer returned to the department and voluntarily resigned, Lindsay said. The investigation continues, he said. In a statement obtained by CNN affiliate WGN, the Academy for Learning said it could not comment on an incident involving a specific student. But, the school said, \"Unfortunately, the physical restraint of a student sometimes becomes necessary. In such instances, AFL and its staff are committed to employing techniques that are safe, effective and which conform to best practice standards. \"Annually, a Behavioral Intervention Committee comprised of administrators, staff, union representatives and parents convenes to review restraint procedures. The AFL Behavior Management Team also participates in professional development and training regarding physical restraint on an annual basis. After a physical restraint occurs, the team meets to process, debrief and evaluate the incident and use of a physical restraint. AFL addresses the unauthorized or inappropriate use of a physical restraint, or improper techniques, as necessary, as an internal manner.\" Pitts' parents are considering litigation against the city of Dolton, the school and Dolton police, Manzke said. He added he is in talks with Dolton police to settle the case. If those talks are not fruitful, Manzke said, a lawsuit could be filed within a few weeks. Pitts is now living with his father and attending another school, Manzke said.

An extraordinary collection of aerial photographs of World War One trenches has come to light nearly a century after the conflict. The images were collected by Sergeant Alex Statters, who served in France and helped to draw up maps of the battlefield on behalf of the Allied forces. They show how the trenches snaked across the countryside, which was pock-marked with hundreds of shell craters from the bombardment of the two sides. The photographs form part of a scrapbook compiled by Sgt Statters during the war, which also includes the telegram announcing the end of the conflict and a signed portrait of Winston Churchill. The book does not provide details of where and when the pictures were taken or of Sgt Statters service. He appears to have been a Royal Engineer (RE). Sapper were responsible for using balloons and aeroplanes to carry out reconnaissance missions above the trenches - the planes being flown by pilots from Army air units, and when it was formed, the Royal Air Force. The missions were fraught with danger and technical difficulty. As well as being targets for the Germans who would fire from the ground and attack from the air, taking pictures involved holding the camera firmly and hoping that the exposure was quick enough not to be shaken. Photographs had to have sufficient resolution to be of use to Royal Artillery gunnery crews on the ground, meaning that plate glass film was initially used. As technology advanced, lighter cameras were brought in, but compared to modern technology, they were still large, heavy and difficult to use. One of the documents on auction along with Sgt Statters' collection of pictures names a 'topo' - 'topography' unit, suggesting that he was part of one. These units were responsible for plotting where British batteries would be sited, and were part of the RE's Field Survey Companies, which produced reports which allowed Royal Artillery intelligence officers to plot both where to site their batteries, and where enemy guns were positioned. As the war progressed, more and more men were involved technology advanced, and the scale of the RE's operation expanded, so that by July 1918, the companies were upgraded to battalions. Artillery had become the deadliest killer in the trenches rapidly and dominated the war, meaning that assessing the impact of shells on the enemy, the accuracy of aim, and the location of enemy positions was crucial. It is unclear if Sgt Statters flew himself or acquired the pictures in the course of his work. The book is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch around \u00a32,500. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Aerial view: the location and timing of this view is unknown but it shows something of the scale of trench systems which were used by both the Allies and the Germans. There is very little evidence of shell damage, suggesting that these are newly entrenched areas - which could either by the start of the war, or more likely towards the very end when movement had resumed. They could also be training trenches, although their scale makes that unlikely. On the left of the picture, the trenches have a regular pattern but angular sections jutting out. This was intended to allow for sniper fire to protect against an incursion from no man's land. Across the top of the picture is a lengthy communications trench, which zig-zags to make sniper fire more difficult, and also to make it more difficult for artillery fire to rake it. It connects to other what are more likely to be front line trenches, which are in two rows running from top to bottom of the picture. The trenches are dug in a pattern lik . Damage: This photograph shows how the countryside was covered in shell craters from the aerial bombardment campaign carried out by both sides. The picture is one of the few which has information on it, dated 24 June 1917 top right corner. The date is shortly after the Battle of Messines had been launched. it is not known if this is in that area, but the scale of damage suggests a heavy bombardments.The remains of the roads which covered the area can still be seen. Close-up: It is hard to grasp the scale of trench warfare, but each section of the zig zag would have been between five and ten feet long. Zig zags were protective: if an enemy party managed to enter the trench, they could not fire down its length, and a soldier could defend the corner as long as ammunition - or more primitive weapons - held out. But the number of shell hols shows the constant danger soldiers were under. it also suggests the area is the very front line - the commucations trenches curve back from it towards the left of the photograph, but do not appear to project much further. Some short trenches extend beyond the apparent front line, which seems to run from top to bottom. They may be the remains of older workings. Intricate: This photograph is dated 18 March 1918. At the time both sides were experiencing something of a calm period - but only for a few more days. On 21 March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive. Fortified in numbers thanks to Russia being out of the war, and using newly developed tactics of stormtroopers moving rapidly, they broke through the Allies positions, overran the trenches, and opened a war of movement. In the end, however, the Spring Offensive was seen by many historians as the Germans' undoing as the country did not have the resources to support the newly mobile armies, and their supply chains suffered. This photograph shows how trneches were built with forward-projecting sections like the tops of medieval battlements, and also built in rows. The presence of the corner at the top centre of the picture suggests some form of change of direction in the trenches, possibly due to change in the topography - the section here is built on flat ground. This picture is one of the few with specific geographical details. It appears to be taken in the air above German positions near Cambrai, in the Somme, and Arras, in the Nord Pas de Calais. At the top left is an arrow pointing towards the Bois de Bourlon, which is around three miles south-west of Arras. To the right is the village of Anneux, which is just outside Cambrai. In the front is the Hindeburg Line, a German defensive system which ran south from Arras. It was built in the winter of 1916 and 1917 and designed to hold off an expected offensive which the Germans believed would happen in the summer of 1917. The Hindenburg Line in fact largely held and although the Germans lost land in front of it (in this picture the fields in the foreground) it appeared to prevent a larger breakthrough by the Allies. The photograph is date 17 August 1917, by which time British offensives in the area had largely ended following the Second battle of Bullecourt. However there were further offensives after this photograph and in November 1917 Anneux was taken  by the 62nd (West Riding) Division on 20 and 21 November 1917. Anneux remained in Allied hands until the following 6 December. It was recaptured on 27 September 1918, by the 57th (West Lancashire) and 63rd (Royal Naval) Divisions, acting with the 52nd (Lowland) and the 1st and 4th Canadian Divisions. It is today home to a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery, with the majority of soldier buried there from the Canadian army. This photograph has no geography or date, and shows both trenches and what appear to be heavy gun emplacements (top centre). The lack of shell damage and the small number of trenches suggests this is behind the front lines, where heavy guns would be emplaced. it is impossible to tell if it was a photograph taken to show German positions or British ones. The Royal Engineers photographed both to allow Royal Artillery intelligence officers to have a complete picture of the battlefield - meaning risky aerial missions with cumbersome cameras. Another undated image suggests positions behind the front lines, as the heaviest shell damage is concentrated at the bottom left. Lengthy communication trenches were needed to bring forward supplies, and although World War One was not a war of movement, the shifting positions of the fronts meant that not all were used all the time. Roads remained crucial - the white chalk road is typical of the north of France or Belgium, while the fields seem unused. It is unclear what the dark sections along the centre represent - it could be something printed on to the pictures to show planned fortifications, or the beginnings of works on the ground. The sheer scale of bombardment, together with the trenches on the right, suggests that this is a section which has recently been the subject of action. The trenches on the right are a front line, although the lack of clear information means whose - and where - is not known. The pictures are marked (top left) with coding which would allow the Royal Engineers and Royal Artillery to assemble an overview of the battlefield. The pictures also show how roads - and in this case what may be the canal of the Somme, running from centre left to bottom right - survived bombardment, At the top of the photograph, however, the intense bombardment means the chalk underneath the topsoil is all that can be seen. Artillery units wanted to rain shells down on trenches, not elsewhere, but accuracy was limited. Shellfire became the main weapon of the war and each side became evenly matched in their ability to produce weapons and ammunition. Historic: Another object in the scrapbook is the telegram announcing the Armistice and the end of the First World War. The underlining of 'Topo' suggests that it was sent to the topographic section of a Royal Engineers Field Survey Battallion, which appears to be where Sgt Statters served. The signal was sent from the headquarters of the British Third Army, which in November 1918 was under the command of General Sir Julian (later Lord) Byng.

His remark immediately ricocheted around the council chambers -- and, in subsequent days, around the country. Councilwoman Virginia Gurrola immediately challenged the mayor. \"It's hard to just grow a pair when you're a 10-year-old girl,\" Gurrola shot back. The councilwoman's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor's tough-talking comments have roiled many people nationwide, especially advocates of bullying prevention. What's bullying . Indeed, in the past few years, a robust debate has been unfolding about what is -- and isn't -- bullying. Sponsors of National Bullying Prevention Month say it's wrong to view bullying as \"a childhood rite of passage\" and something to make \"kids tougher.\" In fact, bullying can be a traumatic experience, causing school avoidance, anxiety, depression and loss of self-esteem. Some researchers, however, say \"bullying\" has been misused and misstated in recent years -- recklessly assigned to describe mere slights, teasing or inevitable growing pains in childhood relationships. The bald, cigar-smoking Hamilton seemed a little wounded this week by the resulting controversy, but he wasn't backing down. He has also received some hate e-mail. \"Of course, I wish I would have put it a little different, a little less colorful, but let's not lose track of what the message is,\" Hamilton said in a CNN interview. Watch Hamilton speak about the controversy . \"We're starting to define any action that is a little bit controversial as bullying,\" he continued. \"We're not addressing the fact that the students are running to or running from (something) or never allowed through the zero-tolerance policies of the schools to actually stand up for themselves. \"The one I worry about the most is physical intimidation, and that's certainly not advocating that we meet violence with violence,\" he said. \"But if somebody puts their hands on you, it's up to you and your friends to put a stop to this.\" People should \"just tell the bully we're not going to put up with this,\" he said. Raising two grandchildren . Hamilton has been raising two grandchildren for 10 years because he lost his daughter in a wreck. \"I guarantee I'm not raising them to be whiny,\" Hamilton said. But he's frustrated with school policies that don't allow bullied pupils to stand up for themselves, he said. His grandson came home from school a month ago after he and another boy had a tussle. In fact, the principal called Hamilton about the incident. \"I asked my grandson afterwards, what'd you do about it?\" Hamilton said. \"I didn't do anything,\" the grandson told him, according to Hamilton. \"Why?\" Hamilton said. \"Because I'll get in trouble,\" the grandson told him. Hamilton expressed exasperation -- and blamed zero-tolerance zones in school as a big part of the problem. Those zones empower bullies, Hamilton said. \"How do you have a safe zone when the schools are telling the kids to stand down and not really holding the bully accountable?\" Hamilton said. \"They don't expel them or don't suspend them. They have them come back to class, and you're brought back in the same environment.\" When Hamilton was in 7th grade, he was bullied by \"a guy that kept pullin' a knife on me,\" he said. \"I made up excuses not to go to school. ... I didn't tell my mom and dad what was going on, didn't tell my friends cause I didn't want them to think I was afraid of this guy,\" Hamilton said. \"Finally it came to a head. I dropped him like a rag doll. Everything was cool again,\" he said. Hate mail . Hamilton acknowledged he's receiving a lot of e-mail excoriating him. \"I could show you e-mails right now that would blow your mind,\" he said. One e-mail was profane and condemning, but Hamilton read it aloud in a CNN interview. \"Hey there mayor... Just reading this makes me want to throw up in my mouth,\" the e-mail read, according to Hamilton. \"You have no idea what it's like to be bullied. You have no idea what it takes for a 10-year-old to stand up to someone who is picking on them. And you have no idea how much bad press you bring on Porterville. That town is a backwards bastion for bigotry, and you made it worse by becoming mayor.\" Among experts taking exception with Hamilton is Simone Bienne, a British human behaviorist and therapist who appears on U.S. television programs. \"I would like to say that the mayor is actually coming off as a bully,\" Bienne said. \"You can very easily say 'I'm against bullying,' but then blame the people, the victims who were being bullied and say grow a pair. \"What does that actually mean? Be braver and you won't get bullied? I don't think that's how bullying works,\" Bienne said. \"If we put responsibility on children to do an adult's job, or to do a politician's job or to do a teacher's job, then what we are basically doing is asking children -- children! -- to be adults.\"", "summary": "The councilwoman's retort was just the beginning of how the mayor's tough-talking comments have roiled many people nationwide, especially advocates of bullying prevention . \"I guarantee I'm not raising them to be whiny,\" Hamilton said .

Fontaine said police subsequently met with him several times, including as recently as Oct. 9, when she said he indicated that wanted to take steps to change. They also met his parents and the imam of his mosque and tried to exert a positive influence over him.

The driver died, 25-year-old Martin Couture Rouleau, had become influenced by radical Islam . Fontaine said they couldn't arrest him for having radical thoughts. It was not known whether Couture-Rouleau had any ties to Islamic militant groups. 'He was part of our investigative efforts to try and identify those people who might commit a criminal act travelling abroad for terrorist purposes,' Paulson said. Canada raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday due to 'an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations like ISIL, al-Qaida, al-Shabab and others who pose a clear threat to Canadians,' said Jean-Christophe de Le Rue, a spokesman for the public safety minister. 'This increase is not the result of a specific threat,' de Le Rue said. Nobody answered the door at Couture-Rouleau's single story white brick home in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he lives with his father. Neighbor Daniel Fortin said he had known Couture-Rouleau since he was a child. Fortin said over the past year or so, he grew out his beard and began wearing loose-fitting Muslim clothing but that he never felt threatened by him. Fortin said Couture-Roleau's father was worried as he became increasingly radicalized and 'tried everything,' to help him.

The body of Emmett Trapp was found by search and rescue personnel at 11:30 a.m. about one mile from his home, lying in a muddy pit once used to collect waste products from a former mining site. \"We are just devastated by the loss of this little boy,\" sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said. The area where his body was found on the former Iron King Mine site is being treated as a crime scene, which the sheriff's office described as \"common protocol.\" The cause of death appears to be a result of spending more than 24 hours exposed to Arizona's elements, Sgt. Jeff Newnum said. An autopsy was scheduled to be performed later Wednesday, he said. He added that there was \"no foul play at Emmett's body that would suggest something was awry.\" Emmett was the second 2-year-old boy to go missing from Yavapai County in 10 days. His case is believed to be unrelated to the disappearance of Sylar Newton -- another 2-year-old who went missing July 25 from a camping site in Rimrock and is presumed dead, D'Evelyn said Tuesday. Emmett was reported missing by his mother at 8 p.m. Monday, the sheriff's office said in a news release. The mother told authorities that she and her four children were at their home in the Dewey-Humboldt area, about 80 miles north of Phoenix. When the mother awoke from a nap Monday evening, Emmett -- last seen wearing a pajama top, diaper and no shoes -- was missing. The family dog had also apparently wandered off with Emmett, but returned when called. The mother told police she searched around the home and immediate area without success. Newnum said the door to the house was unlocked at the time of Emmett's disappearance, and it appears the boy walked as many four miles, crossing hilly, rough terrain, before he was found. Newnum credited the muddy terrain in the area with helping find Emmett.

Despite this, after today's announcement that the country's gross domestic product had fallen for the first time since 2009, many Russians would be expected to be striking caviar off their shopping lists. Sliding oil prices and Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine have continued to take their toll on Russia, whose wealthier citizens have started to move their money abroad.

Warning: Ukraine's Yatsenyuk, right, says that President Putin wants his country to remain under Russian influence . The tough new measures against Russia will be unveiled as Ukraine today accused pro-Moscow rebels of waging fresh attacks in eastern Ukraine despite a ceasefire imposed on Friday. The sanctions are expected to prevent them raising funds for periods longer than 30 days, effectively shutting them off from EU capital markets. Action is also expected against two dozen senior Russian names including those in Mr Putin's circle. Tough new sanctions against Russia have been unveiled by the EU, with some set to target associates of President Vladimir Putin (left) and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (right) Rosneft, an oil monolith, is run by Mr Putin's close associate Igor Sechin.\u00a0Gazpromneft is an oil-production and refining subsidiary of OAO Gazprom, while Transeft is involved in oil transportation. Military linked companies Oboronprom, United Aircraft Corp. and Uralvagonzavod are also expected to be prevented from fundraising in the EU. Formal approval of the measures was expected later on Monday. They are expected to come into effect on Tuesday.

Mr Poroshenko's trip to the strategic port, just days after it faced sustained rebel fire, underscored that Kiev is unlikely to willingly loosen what remains of its grip on Ukraine's rebellious east.

Russian and U.S. officials will meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss a nuclear arms treaty whose future is in doubt. Washington and Moscow have questioned each other's commitment to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and their relationship has deteriorated over the Ukraine crisis. Interfax new agency quoted Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the Russian Foreign Ministry's non-proliferation and arms control department, as saying talks  would take place this week involving Rose Gottemoeller, U.S. Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security. The INF treaty eliminated nuclear and conventional ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of 300-3,400 miles near the end of the Cold War. The U.S. says Russia has violated the treaty by testing a ground-launched cruise missile that is banned under the accord. Meanwhile Russia has questioned Washington's observation of the treaty, saying U.S. use of armed drones amounted to a violation of its terms. He also alleged that Russia had massed military hardware at Sloviyanoserbsk in Lugansk region. After representatives of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) left a roadblock of the Ukrainian National Guard there, it was surrounded by four T-72 Russian tanks, two airborne combat vehicles, two armoured infantry vehicles, four mechanized infantry combat vehicles and about 70 soldiers. EU President Herman Van Rompuy said the new sanctions due to be approved on Monday could be reviewed if the ceasefire was 'durable'. 'We have noted that Russia only consented with difficulty to serious negotiations. The ceasefire is an important step, but it is only a step,' he said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has vowed to respond to any new sanctions, hinting that Western air companies would be barred from using Siberian airspace for flights between Europe and Asia. If the Russian energy and financial industries are hit, then 'we will have to respond asymmetrically - for example, with restrictions in the transport sphere.' If European airlines are forced to fly around Russian airspace - for example on routes to and from Asia on which they overfly Siberia - it could threaten their viability, he said. 'It may lead to bankruptcy of many airlines that are teetering on the brink of survival,' he said. 'We would just like our partners to realise that', he said. And in a further development, there were new fears for the Ukraine ceasefire today as premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Vladimir Putin of sucking his country's blood while warning Kiev would impose martial law. Fragile ceasefire: Ukrainian soldiers guard a checkpoint as the tense truce entered its third day . The premier alleged Mr Putin's plan remained unchanged - to dismember Ukraine as a country - despite a truce which is already under strain three days after it was signed. He said that\u00a0If the ceasefire breaks, Ukraine would impose martial law despite Western objections. 'This means that the entire country will be running on entirely military lines, starting from civil defence and ending with the military command having full power on Ukrainian territory,' he said in an interview on Kiev's One Plus One TV. People take advantage of a break in fighting to queue for food outside a Red Cross building in Mariupol . 'This is war. We have one now. It has not been legally declared. But it's war.' He forecast the West would object because martial law would close off talks on a peace plan and resolving the crisis by non-military methods, but he questioned Mr Putin's sincerity over Ukraine. 'Do I believe the Russian Federation and its president? Categorically, no,' he said. 'Has President Putin changed his plans? Under no circumstances. 'His plan is to return Ukraine to the Russian sphere of influence by any means - by conquering it militarily or politically, or by destroying the state as such.' The port city of Mariupol, above, has been hit by shelling in recent days despite the ongoing ceasefire . President Putin's aim was to turn eastern Ukraine into 'unrecognised republics' like Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia or Transnistria in Moldova, where Russia holds sway, and grave damage has been done already to Lugansk and Donetsk, he said. 'He wants to control and via his mercenaries suck Ukraine's blood,' he said. 'All the infrastructure is destroyed. We've reached the point where we have problems with coal, because they targeted mines with their rockets and tanks. They have blown up railways. They destroyed the energy sector as such.' Stating that Ukraine would end its dependence on Russian gas in five years as it turns towards the West, he said there could be no return to 'business as usual' with Moscow. 'The world does not have the right to forget about Russian aggression. Russia must pay the price. Yes, we are for making peace. But we are also for ensuring that those who breached the peace, who violated the UN charter, violated all possible and impossible bilateral and multilateral agreements, pay the price. And that is the Russian Federation.' He claimed the ceasefire was necessary now 'in order to save lives', allow troops to regroup. But he appeared to doubt that the conditions exist for a lasting truce, amid fighting in three cities since it came into operation. He added that the conditions were that 'the shooting stops. Second, Mr Putin withdraws his mercenaries, his army and his hardware. Third, Ukraine fully restores control over the state border.'", "summary": "And in a further development, there were new fears for the Ukraine ceasefire today as premier Arseniy Yatsenyuk accused Vladimir Putin of sucking his country's blood while warning Kiev would impose martial law .

The incident occurred when a forklift unloading a vessel punctured a large container and the drums inside it that contained the explosive compound PETN, said Morehead City Police spokeswoman Amy Thompson. PETN was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to set off an explosion aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 as it approached Detroit, Michigan, on December 25. PETN is a highly explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Thompson quoted Morehead City Fire Chief Wes Lail as saying the entire cleanup is a five-step process, and only the first step had been completed. There have been no injuries or any environmental damage, according to Carteret County officials. Some residents and business workers left the area, but Tompson said she didn't know how many. \"Right now our advice to everybody is if they're uncomfortable staying in downtown Morehead, to evacuate further west. And if they choose to stay home, stay away from windows and doors,\" Mayor Jerry Jones told CNN. \"Don't get out and sightsee and meander around. It is dangerous, and we need to ensure the safety of our public. As the day goes on and we feel like we have more information, we will pass that information on.\" He said that emergency management officials \"feel that everything is contained.\" But at the early stages in the cleanup, they advised keeping people from getting closed to the port. Carteret County officials said U.S. 70 will be closed from 4th Street in Morehead City to the Morehead-Beaufort high-rise bridge for most of the day. The Coast Guard has barred traffic to and from the zone. The Coast Guard captain of the port ordered the facility closed and a 300-yard safety zone has been established to exclude any vessels operating any closer. Jones said the port called the city before 4:45 a.m. ET to say that a product spilled out of drums on the port property. \"We immediately identified it was a hazardous material, assessed that it was contained on the port and not (going) to go into our neighboring waters, into the waterway,\" he said. Police, fire and explosive ordnance crews from nearby Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point arrived at the scene, and an incident command center was set up nearby. Jones confirmed that the material in the containers is PETN, allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to bomb Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in Amsterdam on December 25. PETN is a high explosive organic compound belonging to the same chemical family as nitroglycerin. Jones said PETN is a crystal packaged in water for stability. He said the people who transport \"any highly flammable explosive devices\" have to and did notify the port and local emergency and police officials. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Chris O'Neil said the substance has industrial and medical uses. \"Being an international port, we handle highly flammable explosive material all the time. Jet fuel comes through here all the time, gasoline, propane. So it's not unusual to have explosive material coming through Morehead City,\" he said.

What works so well in the film, which sees the pair's undercover cops head to work on a college campus, is what cements the duo's bond off-screen: a raunchy, daring sense of humor. For example, the \"X-rated\" bet that they made before the opening of \"21 Jump Street\" -- wherein Hill promised to \"kiss the tip\" of a certain part of Tatum's anatomy through his underwear if they reached $35 million that first weekend -- is exactly the kind of off-the-wall camaraderie that comes across on screen. \"For this kind of movie,\" Hill observed at the premiere, \"the friendship translates into what the movie's about, which is kind of rad.\" CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.", "summary": "The concept is a spin on the '80s TV series of the same name, and, like in the TV show, Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko are at first sent to work undercover in a high school . \" CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report . \"Sometimes you take a movie because you like someone's work, and then you get to work with them and you don't actually enjoy working with them"}, {"article": "By .

Davenport, who is a Tea Party activist and an elected member of the central committee of the Republican Party of Orange County, said she felt the e-mail was a joke, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. The e-mail contains a doctored photo of what appears to be a family portrait of two adult chimpanzees posing with a young chimpanzee with Obama's face pasted on it. The caption that ran with the photo says \"Now you know why no birth certificate,\" the affiliate reported. Davenport said she would not repeat her error in the apology that included two Bible passages. \"I am an imperfect Christian lady who tries her best to live a Christ-like honoring life,\" the statement said. \"I would never do anything to intentionally harm or berate others regardless of ethnicity. So I ask for your forgiveness, for I am truly sorry.\" Despite criticism, Davenport told the affiliate that she does not need to resign her position because of the e-mail.

The 23-year-old has been ever-present in Saints' charge to second place in the Barclays Premier League, making the right back shirt his own following Calum Chambers' move to Arsenal. He was rewarded with a first international call-up for last month's Euro 2016 double header against San Marino and Estonia but was an unused substitute in both games. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's  Big Match Stats: Hull  vs Southampton . Nathaniel Clyne beats Mohamed Diame for pace before whipping in a cross against Hull on Saturday . 'It's always good to play for your country. If you play well then you get picked up,' he said. 'I think I've got the ability to play for my country, definitely. I'm playing with lots of confidence. 'Hopefully I can get called up again and receive my first cap.' Southampton needed a mis-hit clearance from Hull's third-choice goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic and wonderful 40-yard strike from Victor Wanyama to see off Hull on Saturday, but their winning habit is becoming unshakeable. When previous boss Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham in the summer and the likes of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren followed him out of the door, a season of struggle was widely predicted. England manager Roy Hodgson was in attendance to see Southampton duo Fraser Forster and Clyne . Yet they have now won 10 of their last 11 matches in all competitions, with the meanest defence in the top flight and only Chelsea above them. Unsurprisingly, spirits are high. 'We keep winning and getting clean sheets, hopefully we can keep up our run of form and see where we go with it,' said Clyne. 'A few of the lads are talking about the Europa League, Europe and stuff. But we've just got to keep pushing and hopefully the results will take care of themselves.' Hull, meanwhile, were unable to build on battling draws at Arsenal and Liverpool in their previous two matches. The young full-back has been one of Southampton's most impressive performers this season . Despite the slender scoreline, Southampton were clearly the better side and could have added as many as three to their tally with better finishing. Nevertheless, they would be forgiven for wondering what might have been had Jakupovic, starting in the Premier League for only the third time with Allan McGregor and Steve Harper injured, not erred. He sent the ball straight to Wanyama when attempting to clear, leaving himself badly out of position as the ball sailed back into his net. But midfielder Stephen Quinn insists the Swiss must put the incident behind him as soon as possible. Clyne was called up to train with the national squad but didn't make an actual appearance . 'It's been difficult for Eldin, he's been a long time out as second or third choice keeper and he came in and did ever so well at Liverpool last week,' said Quinn. 'He's a good keeper, but he made a simple mistake and a lot of the time you can get away with those. 'I'm sure he will be dejected but he's got to be a man about it and get his head up because it looks like he'll be starting again next week. 'You can't dwell on it.

Show will go on: Here, the late actor Paul Walker is seen in a still from his upcoming film Hours, about the tragedy of Hurricane Katrina. Producers have announced they'll proceed with the planned December 13 release of the film despite its star's death Saturday in a fiery car crash . The Hollywood Reporter points out that the film\u2019s subject matter may have been one of great personal interest to Walker. The 40-year-old father of one had a charity he founded in 2010 in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Haiti. And his own tragedy came during a Santa Clarita, California charity function on Saturday for those affected by the recent typhoon in the Philippines. \u2018Hours embodies a message that was so important to him, which is that you have to do everything you can to keep friends and family safe,\u2019 producer Peter Safran told the Hollywood Reporter.

'Important to him': Producer Peter Safran said the subject matter was Walker's personal passion. The actor died Saturday during a charity event for victims of the recent typhoon in the Philippines . Walker was killed when the 2005 Porsche Carrera GT he was in with his friend and former race car driver Roger Rodas, 38, went out of control and smashed into a tree.

China launched an experimental spacecraft early Friday that is scheduled to orbit the moon before returning to Earth, a first for the country's ambitious space program and considered a precursor to a planned mission to the moon. The unmanned spacecraft was launched by a Long March 3C rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan, western China, state media said. It is China's first lunar module capable of returning to Earth and the mission's main technical challenge will be making sure the spacecraft slows down enough to re-enter Earth's atmosphere safely. Too fast and it could overheat or become difficult to track and control, Hu Hao, chief designer of the lunar exploration program, told The China Daily. It is expected to take around a week to fly around the moon. The spacecraft will end its mission by landing on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The mission tests technology that will be used in a more ambitious launch, scheduled to take place in 2017, when an unmanned lunar probe will go to the moon, collect soil samples and return home. Chinese astronauts have made five manned space flights on a series of Shenzhou \"Divine Vessel\" modules, with the latest mission in 2013 completing a successful manual docking with the Tiangong-1 space station. Last December, China put a lunar rover -- known as the Jade Rabbit -- on the moon but it has been plagued by mechanical troubles, the China Daily said. On course for the moon? Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College, said the lunar orbiter marks a step forward in the capabilities needed for a potential manned lunar program, which while under discussion hasn't been officially approved yet. \"It's significance is not only in demonstration of technical abilities, but in a continued political will to achieve its space goals over long periods of time \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which is what China has that the U.S. currently lacks.\" While the United States has pulled back its space program, other countries are trying to match or surpass China's accomplishments in what some observers have called an Asian space race. In September, India became the first Asian country to send an orbiter around Mars. Political symbolism . China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and has made rapid advances in the intervening decade. Despite this, its space program is still yet to achieve capabilities reached by the U.S. and then Soviet Union decades ago, says James A. Lewis, director and senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. With little economic or military advantage, its value, he says, lies in how the space program shapes China's perception of itself -- a conspicuous display of national power and wealth that asserts China's return to confidence and authority. \"We could ask if China is following an outdated recipe for superpower status,\" he writes in a blog for the University of Nottingham in the UK. \"In terms of the global effect of the manned program, there might be some truth to this. But for the domestic audience that is the chief concern of China's leaders, the space program produces invaluable results.\"", "summary": "Way away -- to the moon, in fact .

Rescue crews were scouring the north of San Francisco Bay for a missing pilot after two small vintage planes collided while heading home from a show, sending one crashing into the water while the other miraculously managed to land. Debris was found in San Pablo Bay after the 4.05pm collision near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, but the pilot has still not been found, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Loumania Stewart. The mid-air crash involved a single engine 1965 Cessna 210 and a World War Two era Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20, piloted by a husband and wife crew, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. Scary: Two small planes collided over San Pablo Bay near San Francisco on Sunday . The Cessna crashed into the water and the Sea Fury's pilot was able to land 40 minutes later at Eagle's Nest Airport in the small Northern California city of Ione, Gregor said. Amador County firefighters and medics sent to the Ione airport were not needed because the pilot and passenger in the Sea Fury - a husband and wife - were not injured, the county's Undersheriff Jim Wegner said. Both planes had departed from Eagle's Nest Airport to participate in the Pacific Coast Dream Machines, an annual festival in Half Moon Bay that features a variety of planes, motorcycles, and cars. Both planes left Half Moon Bay Airport, about 20 miles south of San Francisco, and were on their return flight to Ione. Miracle: One of the planes was able to land safely at an air field a few miles away from the bay . Witnesses at Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Cessna spiraled out of control and crashed into the choppy water after the collision. 'Everyone associated with the Pacific Coast Dream Machines Show is terribly saddened by this news and we hope and pray the missing plane and survivors are found,' the event organizers said in a statement. Four Coast Guard boats and a helicopter searched the choppy bay waters, along with five boats from local law enforcement agencies, including the Marin County Sheriff's Office and the Sausalito Police Department, as well as a local helicopter. 'It clipped a wing, probably lost a wing, spun violently and hit the water,' said witness Eric Johnson to KTVU. 'Tragic. The plane spinning that hard, you can't jump out, you can't get away. It's really sad.' Divers from the San Francisco Police Department also were on the scene. Wegner wouldn't discuss damage to the Sea Fury, citing the ongoing investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board. The names of the pilots involved have not been released as of Monday morning. Search: Rescuers are now searching the San Pablo Bay near San Francisco for the second plane involved in the collision .

Arnold Schwarzenegger. Those guests and others capped his 25-year run behind the microphone with CNN. \"Welcome to the last 'Larry King Live.' It's hard to say that,\" King said in his opening remarks to his last show. He was joined on the set by comedian Bill Maher and television host Ryan Seacrest. On several occasions, King stifled tears, especially when Maher put King in the same company as TV legends Johnny Carson, Steve Allen and Walter Cronkite. \"This is not Larry's funeral,\" Maher interjected early in the show. \"Larry is hopefully going to be in our living rooms for years to come. This is the end of a show, not the end of a man.\" King wore his signature suspenders -- a pair of red ones with a red-and-white polka-dot tie over a black shirt. At end of his hourlong broadcast, King became choked up with his final sentences. \"It's not very often in my life that I've been without words,\" King said. He thanked his staff and producers. \"When I started 25 years ago in a little studio in Washington, D.C., I never thought it would last this long or come to this,\" King said. \"I'm going to do specials on CNN and do radio work ... so you're not going to see me go away, but you're not going to see me on this set any more. \"I don't know what to say, except to you my audience, thank you. And instead of goodbye, how about so long?\" King concluded. His set then went black -- except for a spotlight illuminating his chrome microphone. In his overall 53 years in broadcasting, King amassed 50,000 interviews, 6,120 shows in CNN's archives, 10 Cable ACE Awards, an Emmy, a Peabody and an entry in the Guinness World Records for having the longest-running show with the same host in the same time slot. Among the guests on the last show was Schwarzenegger, who appeared by a satellite transmission from the capital of Sacramento. The governor extended congratulations and displayed the written proclamation declaring Thursday as belonging to King. \"Thank you,\" King said, adding this quip: \"and keep this in mind: I'll be back.\" King will be working on special projects for CNN. In a pre-recorded videotaped message, President Obama called King \"one of the giants in broadcasting.\" \"You say all that you do is ask questions, but for generations of Americans, the answers to those questions have surprised us and they have informed us,\" Obama said. From a studio in New York, talk show host Regis Philbin tried to engage King in a song, but King was caught off guard. \"I lost the $500 question,\" King joked. Joining Philbin in New York was Donald Trump. \"You shouldn't be leaving anything, Larry,\" Trump said. \"Nobody ever did it better.\" Also in New York was comic Fred Armisen, who dressed up exactly like King and then started interviewing him. \"Now Larry,\" Armisen said, \"what has been my favorite interview?\" King: \"You know you've done so many, it's hard to pick one out.\" Armisen: \"Larry, what is the most interesting thing about me.\" King: \"The most interesting about you is you're a little whacko.\" Armisen: \"What question have you asked more than any?\" King: \"Why. You see the best question of all, Lar, is why. Because it can't be answered in one word and it forces the person to think.\" Armisen: \"Besides holding up my pants, why do I wear suspenders?\" King: \"I will not stop wearing them. No matter what I do in life, the suspenders will remain.\" News anchors Katie Couric, Diane Sawyer, and Brian Williams joined talk show host Barbara Walters in extending farewells. They were also telecasted from a set in New York. \"We are your prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, your groupies,\" Sawyer said, giving King a pair of suspenders embroidered with the four guests' and King's names. \"All of us have done heads of state\" interviews, Walters said. \"No one has done more than you.\" After King moved the conversation to Williams, Williams remarked: \"You've just done what scores of network executives have been unable to do. You just snatched airtime from Barbara Walters.\" Couric read from a poem she wrote for King, in which one verse went: . \"You made NAFTA exciting and that's hard to do. \"And you scored the Paris Hilton post-jail interview,\" Couric recited. Former president Bill Clinton, who just returned from a visit to Haiti and was in Little Rock, Arkansas, said he admired King's work ethic. Clinton had appeared 28 times on King's show. \"I'm like you,\" Clinton said in a live feed from Arkansas. \"I have to keep working. I don't know if it keeps me young, but it keeps me out of the grave.\" Seacrest read from a letter written to King from the Rev. Billy Graham, who wrote: \"You will be greatly missed in my evening routine.\" Talk show host Dr. Phil McGraw joined the Hollywood set toward the end of the show and asked King how he felt. King turned the question on McGraw: \"How am I doing?\" \"With grace,\" McGraw said. \"You never like to be the center of attention,\" McGraw later said. \"You ask short questions.\" Turning to Seacrest and Maher, he added: \"He told me years ago, if it's more than 2 sentences, it's too long.\" King was then joined by his wife, Shawn, and two sons, Chance, 11, and Cannon, 10, to hear Tony Bennett sing \"Best is Yet to Come\" from Lake Charles, Louisiana. \"How about them apples,\" King said afterwards. \"Thanks for all the great interviews you've given us, Larry,\" Bennett said. Chance said he looked forward to seeing more of his father. Cannon then stole the show momentarily with an uncanny impersonation of his father, as if he were talking to him and then his mother: . \"Get in the car. I'm too old for this. I've done this for 50 years,\" Cannon said, with an entertaining imitation of King's gravelly voice. \"Stop doing your makeup. This is the last show. We're going to be late.\" When King ended his last show and the airtime moved on to Anderson Cooper for his show, the anchor summarized: \"a remarkable moment and a remarkable man.\"", "summary": "And instead of goodbye, how about so long?\" King concluded .

The high cost of medical care and treatment has some sick people opting out of treatment, a survey finds. Specifically, 24 percent of people polled in the 2009 Deloitte Survey of Health Care Consumers decided not to seek medical care when they were sick or injured. The largest subgroups were those who were uninsured (36 percent), and those between ages 28 and 44, referred to as \"Gen Y\" respondents in the survey (37 percent). Two-fifths of the people who didn't see a doctor when they needed one did so because of the high cost of care. They either didn't have medical insurance coverage or they perceived the cost of such care to be excessive, according to the survey, which was released early Tuesday to CNN by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions, a nonpartisan, independent research center. \"Costs are impacting the system, and it's changing how we respond to our health care,\" said Paul Keckley, executive director of the center. In addition to data about how many Americans fail to seek necessary medical care because of high costs, another theme that emerged in the survey focused on consumers' dissatisfaction with the nation's health-care system: . \u2022 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security. \u2022 More than half said they think 50 percent or more of the money spent by Americans on health care is a waste. \u2022 Only 6 percent indicated their own family is totally prepared to shoulder the financial burden they expect to face. Not only are Americans putting off health care and facing increasing dissatisfaction, they are also shopping around for better deals on doctors' fees, prescription medication prices or health insurance plans to cut costs, according to the survey. There has been a lot of perceived loyalty and commitment in health care, Keckley said, and many providers think patients will stay with them. \"This study suggests that people really don't [stay],\" Keckley added. \"And that's surprising.\" Despite the desire to shop around and gather more information to make improved decisions about their health-care choices, the abundance of options also can be baffling, says Kathleen Stoll, deputy director of Families USA. The group is a nonprofit, nonpartisan health care advocacy organization that regularly advises consumers on choosing insurance coverage plans. \"People weigh the costs of deductibles versus premiums, and these options can be confusing. They are asking themselves, 'What is it that I can afford in the family budget?' I sense a lot of people feeling unnerved by having to choose less [insurance] coverage because that's all they can afford,\" Stoll told CNN. The survey also underscored Americans' receptiveness to innovations that potentially lower costs and offer greater convenience, pointing toward growing preferences for options such as retail walk-in primary care clinics in drug stores, medical tourism (high-quality, relatively inexpensive medical procedures obtained abroad) and Web-based medical services (often referred to as e-visits). Sampling a nationally representative group of more than 4,000 adults using a Web-based questionnaire, the survey was funded by the center's parent company, Deloitte LLP, which has a wide range of clients in the health care industry. The center released its first version of the annual survey results in 2008. Last month, the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation released its own health-care survey findings, with even greater numbers reflecting cutbacks in spending on medical services and treatments. According to the report, more than half of American households scaled back health-care spending in the previous 12 months before the survey, which was conducted in early February. Families relied on home remedies and over-the-counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time, and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time.", "summary": "Families relied on home remedies and over-the-counter medications instead of going to the doctor about 35 percent of the time, and they skipped visits to the dentist 34 percent of the time . \u2022 94 percent of respondents said they believe health-care costs threaten their own financial security .

It also greatly reduces the likelihood of a prolonged insurgency by Gadhafi loyalists and allows the transitional government to move forward with the hard work of building a new political system. The challenges ahead are great: Since the Gadhafi regime so effectively monopolized the public sphere, Libya has no real civil society or effective political institutions. After decades of tyranny, there is a deep distrust of government. There is also fear of revenge killings by those who suffered under Gadhafi's brutality. Tensions are already evident between Islamists and secularists, and between technocrats returning from abroad and those who stayed and opposed the regime at enormous personal expense. Well-armed militias have yet to be formally disbanded or integrated into a national army; large caches of arms, including some sophisticated missiles, are not accounted for and could end up in the hands of extremists. Nevertheless, of all the Arab states that have been convulsed by revolts this year, Libya has by far the strongest economic prospects. Its relatively small population of 6.5 million and vast oil wealth give it the best chance of meeting the economic aspirations of its citizens. Just recently, the transitional government announced that it had discovered an additional $23 billion  in the Central Bank of Libya, enough to cover the costs of government for at least six months. It has an additional $160 billion in foreign assets, which are  frozen overseas but will eventually be released. Libya also has a relatively well-educated population. Public education was free and compulsory through secondary school under Gadhafi, and the country enjoys a literacy rate of nearly 90%. In the 2007-2008 school year, women enrolled in universities outnumbered men significantly. According to the Transitional National Council constitution, legislative and presidential elections to form a new government must be held within a year of liberation. The constitution also stipulates that no member of the council can participate in this newly elected government, a provision meant to limit the influence of the interim body. So far, transitional leaders seem willing to abide by that provision, but jockeying for power has only just begun. Interim Prime Minister Mahmoud Jabril, American educated and unabashedly secular, announced recently that he would step down at the close of the fighting, but it is not clear if he will follow through on his promise, or if he does, who will succeed him. Jabril and Ali Tarhouni, the acting Finance and Oil Minister who was teaching economics in the United States before joining the rebellion, have been criticized for being outsiders, too secular and too connected to remnants of the former regime. Some are pointing to Abdel Hakim Belhaj, the NTC commander of the militia in Tripoli, as a major player in the future political field. Belhaj was arrested in 2004 by the Central Intelligence Agency and rendered to Libya, where he was held and tortured in the infamous Abu Salim prison. The warrant for his arrest accused him of ties to al Qaeda, which he has denied. Belhaj has also disavowed extremism and pledged tolerance. Islamists will undoubtedly play an influential role in Libya's new government, and outward signs of Islamic piety, suppressed under Gadhafi, are now on the rise across the country. But leaders across the political spectrum continue to insist on moderation and tolerance. Mustafa Abdul Jalil, chairman of the transitional council, has called for a Libyan state founded on Sharia that is also inclusive of women and minorities. U.S. and European support for the rebels over the past seven months generated positive feelings among Libyans for NATO countries, which points to a possible Western-aligned Libyan government that is nonetheless markedly Islamic in character. Gadhafi's death marks an important moment of transition for Libyans. Reconciliation and integration will be imperative at this point, especially as the dust of war clears and evidence emerges of brutality committed by both rebel forces and Gadhafi loyalists. As demonstrated painfully in Iraq, lasting stability requires opportunities for Gadhafi supporters to participate in the new order, but with war wounds still fresh, this will require remarkable leadership and forbearance on the part of transitional leaders. A stable, prosperous Libya undergoing a process of democratization will enhance the chance of successful transitions in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.  This helps explain the sense of jubilation across the region that erupted on the news of Gadhafi's death. The era of tyrants seems to be coming to an end. Protesters in Syria and Yemen held out signs asking their leaders if they want to go the same violent way.", "summary": "Belhaj was arrested in 2004 by the Central Intelligence Agency and rendered to Libya, where he was held and tortured in the infamous Abu Salim prison .

Tremayne Gaskell, 46, from Leeds, has been jailed for life for raping the pensioner and robbing her jewellery after meeting at a pub in the city . A sexual predator who tied up and raped a pensioner in her own home while threatening her at knifepoint has been jailed for life. Tremayne Gaskell, from Leeds, already had an 'atrocious' criminal record for violence against women when he targeted the 68-year-old at a pub in Leeds in February this year. The 46-year-old, who was described in court as 'dangerous', then went back to the woman's home where he locked the door, tied her up with tape and stole her jewellery. He then subjected her to horrific sex attacks in an ordeal which did not end until the next morning. At the time of the brutal attack, Gaskell was out of jail on licence after being locked up in September 2012 for stabbing another woman in the face and neck. In a victim impact statement, the woman said she had been so disturbed by the incident that she had moved out of her home and left behind most of her belongings 'that this man had touched'. Gaskell has now been jailed for life after a jury at Leeds Crown Court found him guilty of two offences of rape and one of robbery. The jury of nine women and three men rejected his claims during the trial that his victim had consented to sex. Gaskell, who was arrested two days after . the attack, was told he must serve a minimum of nine years in prison . before he can apply to the parole board for release. Judge James Spencer told him: 'It was cruel. It was nasty, and it shows you for what you are. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. Dangerous in the sense that if you are at large you are ever likely to commit offences of this kind and commit serious physical harm to another human being.' The court heard Gaskell armed himself with the knife before targeting the 'trusting and vulnerable' victim when they met during a night out. Prosecutors also told the jury how the defendant had a long criminal history of serious . violent offences. One attack involved a woman suffering an eye injury . when she was struck in the face with a pistol, while the attack for which he was on licence had led to a three-and-a-half year prison sentence. The court also heard that Gaskell had spent almost every day of his life in prison since 2002. The victim said: 'Since this man did this to me I haven\u2019t been right. Leeds Crown Court heard that Gaskell was out of jail on licence for stabbing another woman in the face and neck when the brutal attack took place . 'I get upset and I end up crying and I can\u2019t sleep at night and I\u2019ve had to stay at my sister\u2019s because I just can\u2019t settle on my own at home. 'I can\u2019t even say what it is that makes me cry but the things this man did to me ran through my mind and I am really frightened. 'In my judgement you are a dangerous man. If you are at large... you are ever likely to commit serious physical harm to another human being' Judge James Spencer . 'After the incident I didn\u2019t go back into my house, which had been my home for five years. I was too scared. I am frightened of him coming back because he said that if I told anyone he would come looking for me and would kill me. 'It is because of this I have given up my home and moved out of the area. 'I did not even take anything out of the house other than my clothes, microwave and stereo as I couldn\u2019t face having the same things in my new home that this man had touched because this would remind me every day about the horrible and nasty things this man had done to me.' Det Chief Inspector Mark Griffin, who heads Leeds District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'These offences clearly show that Gaskell is a sexual predator who presents a serious danger to women. 'We believe he cynically preyed on the vulnerable victim from the outset and had sinister intentions towards her all along. She was put through a prolonged ordeal which has understandably had a lasting traumatic effect on her. 'Police enquiries quickly identified Gaskell as the suspect for these offences and he was traced to the city centre and arrested the next day after being recognised by officers patrolling the area. 'A full and thorough investigation by specialist safeguarding officers has seen him brought to justice and we hope the fact he has now had to answer for his crimes will provide some source of comfort to the victim.'", "summary": "violent offences .

Tens of thousands of attendees perused 500 booths where you could look at guns, buy guns, learn about guns, talk about guns and maybe weep about guns, along with plenty of training courses to prepare you for the day when society breaks down and you finally get the chance to use that arsenal to defend your home against marauding gangs of cannibals. NRA has record conference turnout, new president . One favorite was the trainer who advised people to keep a gun locked up in their kids' room. Because what could possibly go wrong? Oh yeah -- accidents. They could shoot each other, such as the 5-year-old who recently shot his 2-year-old sister, or the 13-year-old who shot his 6-year-old sister. This being an NRA gathering, there were media figures and politicians aplenty. Glenn Beck, fresh off suggesting that a man who shot himself last week at Houston airport's was a part of a Reichstag fire-like conspiracy to pave the way for a fascist crackdown on Americans, gave the keynote address. Prominent politicians who appeared included Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sarah Palin. They have something in common, beyond the fact that they've all run for president before or might in 2016. Like the NRA itself, they all camp out on the conservative fringe but are nevertheless convinced that they represent the mainstream. Perry, who calls Social Security \"a monstrous lie\" and has flirted in the past with the idea that Texas should secede from the United States, thought that what Americans wanted in a president was Yosemite Sam without the intellectual pretensions. Turned out, not so much. Jindal recently suffered a political setback when he proposed cutting the (progressive) income tax and raising the (regressive) sales tax, I guess because poor people in Louisiana have just been having it too easy. Even his conservative state recoiled, and Jindal's approval ratings plummeted. Cruz has cut a McCarthyite swath through Washington in his four months there, leading to rare agreement between Republicans and Democrats that he's an enormous jerk. Naturally, he's seriously considering a run for president in 2016. And as for the former half-term governor of Alaska? Well, you already know about her. All of them believe they represent the real America, and if the country just had a chance to hear their unvarnished views, they could win the White House with ease. That most real Americans find that idea either laughable or terrifying doesn't seem to register with them. They're right at home with the NRA, which just selected as its president a man who still refers to the Civil War as \"the war of Northern aggression,\" and has such a twisted view of liberty that he believes the freedom to buy an AR-15 at a gun show without having to fill out a form is as important as freedom of speech or religion. Eighteen years ago, after a right-wing anti-government extremist bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 men, women and children, NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre railed against the threat from \"jackbooted government thugs\" in \"Nazi bucket helmets.\" In response, former President George H.W. Bush wrote the group an outraged letter defending those who work for the government, including one Secret Service agent killed in Oklahoma City who had worked on Bush's detail in the White House. \"He was no Nazi,\" Bush wrote, and resigned his NRA life membership in disgust. In the time since, the NRA has become even more extreme, even more paranoid, even more ensconced in its self-reinforcing world in which guns are all that matter. There may be a few Republicans who now have the courage to stand up to them. But there are still plenty such as Perry, Cruz and Palin, who will troop to their convention and jump into their festering pool of anger and fear. They don't seem to realize how it makes them smell.

Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:25 AM on 29th February 2012 . Israel said it will not warn the U.S. if it decides to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, American intelligence has revealed. Officials said they would keep America in the dark so that the U.S. would not be held responsible for failing to stop the attack. The pronouncement, delivered in a series of private, top-level conversations, sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the White House and Capitol Hill. No warning: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) will not be told if Israel decides to launch a strike on Iran, Israel PM Benjamin Netanhyhu (right) has said . Decision: Israel has said it will not tell the U.S. in order to decrease the chance Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will blame America for the strike . The U.S. has been working with the Israelis for months to persuade them that an attack would be only a temporary setback to Iran's nuclear programme. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak delivered the message to a series of top-level U.S. visitors to the country. They included the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House national security adviser, the director of national intelligence, and top U.S. lawmakers. All were trying to close the trust gap between Israel and the U.S. over how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu delivered the same message to all the Americans who have travelled to Israel for talks, the U.S. official said in an off-the-record briefing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Pentagon and Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy. Secretive: Iran says it is developing nuclear technology for fuel reasons, but a lack of transparency has led Western powers to be suspicious . Iran claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised alarm that its uranium enrichment programme might be a precursor to building nuclear weapons. The U.S. has said it does not know whether the Iranian government has decided to 'weaponise' its nuclear material and put it on a missile or other delivery device. The Iranian government has hailed the success of a homegrown film at Sunday's Academy Awards as a victory over Israel. 'A Separation' by director Asghar Farhadi won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Picture beating Israeli director Joseph Cedar's 'Footnote'. In a state TV broadcast Javad Shamaghdari, head of the state Cinematic Agency, hailed the win as the 'beginning of the collapse' of Israeli influence that 'beats the drum of war' in the U.S. and elsewhere. He later claimed the Oscar meant 'American judgment was bowed to the Iranian culture'. The film explores troubles in Iranian society through the story of a collapsing marriage. It tells the story of a couple heading for divorce and dealing with domestic troubles, including a young child and an aging parent. Iranian conservatives were upset with the themes of domestic turmoil, gender inequality and the desire by many Iranians to leave the country. In his acceptance speech Mr Farhadi said he hoped the Oscar would raise awareness of Iran's sizable artistic achievements and rich culture that has been 'hidden under the heavy dust of politics'. Surprisingly the film has been a huge hit in Israel, where tens of thousands of movie-goers have flocked to see it since it opened earlier this month. The secret warning is likely to worry U.S. officials and begin the high level meetings with Israel and the U.S. far apart on how to handle Iran. But the apparent decision to keep the U.S. in the dark also stems from Israel's frustration with the White House. After a visit by National Security Adviser Tom Donilon in particular, they became convinced the Americans would neither take military action, nor go along with unilateral action by Israel against Iran. The Israelis concluded they would have to conduct a strike unilaterally - a point they are likely to hammer home in a series of meetings over the next two weeks in Washington, the official said. Barak will meet with top administration and congressional officials during his visit.\u00a0 Netanyahu arrives in Washington for meetings with President Barack Obama next week. The behind-the-scenes warning belies the publicly united front the two sides have attempted to craft with the shuttle diplomacy to each other's capitals. 'It's unprecedented outreach to Israel to make sure we are working together to develop the plan to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and to keep them from exporting terrorism,' said Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. He travelled there with the intelligence committee chairman, Republican Mike Rogers, to meet Israel's prime minister and defence minister, along with other officials. 'We talked about the fact that sanctions are working and they are going to get a lot more aggressive,' Ruppersberger added. They also discussed talked about presenting a unified front to Iran, to counter the media reports that the two countries are at odds over how and when to attack. Programme: The nuclear enrichment facility in the central Iranian city of Natanz . He said: 'We have to learn from North Korea. All those (peace) talks and stalling and they developed a nuclear weapon. 'We are going to send a message, enough is enough, the stalling is over. ... All options are on the table.' Rogers told CNN yesterday: 'I got the sense that Israel is incredibly serious about a strike on their nuclear weapons programme. 'It's their calculus that the administration ... is not serious about a real military consequence to Iran moving forward. 'They believe they're going to have to make a decision on their own, given the current posture of the United States.' U.S. intelligence and special operations officials have tried to keep a dialogue going with Israel, despite the high-level impasse. They have shared with them options such as allowing Israel to use U.S. bases in the region from which to launch such a strike, as a way to make sure the Israelis give the Americans a heads-up, according to the U.S. official. Co-operation has improved on sharing of intelligence in the region, according to one current and one former U.S. official. Israel is providing key information on Syria for instance, now that the U.S. has closed its embassy and pulled out both its diplomats and intelligence officials stationed there, the U.S. official said.", "summary": "S .
